# Customer-Segmentation-ML

This project implements a K-Means Clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: Customer Segmentation.

Customer segmentation helps businesses understand different types of customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

 Dataset
The dataset consists of customer details such as:

Customer ID
Gender
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)

Steps in Clustering
Data Preprocessing - Handle missing values, normalize data if needed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Visualizing customer segments.
Applying K-Means Algorithm - Determining optimal clusters using the Elbow Method.
Clustering Customers - Assigning customers to different groups based on their spending behavior.
Visualization - Using scatter plots to analyze customer segments.

Results
Customers were grouped into X clusters based on their purchasing patterns.
The clusters help identify high-value customers, budget-conscious shoppers, and mid-range buyers.
The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
